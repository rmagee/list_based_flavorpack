The List Based Flavorpack
=========================

The list_based_flavorpack component provides SerialBox with the ability
to request lists of numbers from external systems and then supply those numbers
to other external systems via the SerialBox allocate API.

SerialBox and the List Based Flavorpack are foundational components of the
QU4RTET Open-Source EPCIS Level-4 platform.
